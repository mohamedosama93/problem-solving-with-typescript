#Statement

For two arrays of closed intervals given as input, intervalListA and intervalListB, where each interval has its own start and end time, write a function that returns the intersection of the two interval arrays.

For example, the intersection of [3,8][3,8] and [5,10][5,10] is [5,8][5,8].
